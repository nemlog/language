As for nemlog tips,Firstly this is conclusion ,<span class="red-text text-lighten-1 fw7">「Communication with other user via articles」</span><br /><br />
I think most of nemlog user's motivation to start nemlog is that "want to manetize by posting articles."<br />
It is not wrong,& rather it is a natural way.Everyone wants/needs money.<br /><br />
so, you can monetize effectively just by posting article??? 
It is actually correct answer ,but a mistake...<br /><br />
Currently in nemlog, if you post an article,some people certainly read your article.
Th contents is useful for the reader, several donation will be happened.<br />
Then,if user who is well known posted an article & Unknown user posted "completely same article",which can obtain more donation? 
Noneed to say,of course people tend to donate known user.<br /><br />
<strong>「Bias」</strong> occurs.It is unavoidable.User is not a machine, but human ,so this bias is natural & can't avoid.<br /><br />
so how should we manage this "Bias"?<br /><br />
We have one curious data in nemlog.<br /><strong><span class="red-text text-lighten-1">「Person who most comments to article got the most amount of nem donation」</span></strong><br />（Close tendency as for amount of sending nem donation）<br />
& I found this comment from several users...<strong><span class="red-text text-lighten-1">「nem is returned more than I donated!」</span></strong> maybe you will be able to find frequently this comment.<br />
This is the answer,Significant action is communication with other users,It can increase profit!<br /><br />
There are a lot of ommunication methods in nemlog,
put comment to article,thanks letter for person who donated to you,post answer article & of course ok to tip nem. 
Firstly need to start communication without hesitation
The users who joined nemlog early stage comment on various articles.<br />
I think that they are just enjoying communication ,but they surly recognize the actibity is one of trigger of nem donation.
Probably you will become fun to put comment & reply it.nemlog has such a culture I think.<br /><br />
However,sometimes the article which differ from your opinion is posted.I feel so sometimes even nemlog creator of me.<br />
I think there is several persons who feel "not agree with this article",It is ok! 
Like & dislike must be happened when number of users are increased.It is natural.need to accept diversity,Everyone is different!
You do not have to get along with all users,It's not possible...<br />
At first,why not put comment your favorite articles & users?<br /><br />
nemlog has<strong>「Blog comunication platform」</strong>as great sub-title lol.<br />
But the essence seems to be really there, circulation of nem is happened on the communication.<br /><br />
we love nem,so we must have same things/feeling,must beeasy to communiacte between nemlog users.<br />
Let's read various articles from now on & put comment proactively ,Then...<br />
<p class="font-serif pt20"><strong>Your nemlog life must be change...</strong></p><br />
